# Customer-Segment-Project
Customer segmentation involves dividing a company's customer base into groups based on shared characteristics. This helps businesses tailor their marketing efforts, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize product offerings.
Steps in the Project:

Data Collection:
Gather customer data from sources like sales records, website analytics, or CRM systems. Typical features include demographic details, purchase history, behavior patterns, and transaction data.

Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning: Handle missing or inconsistent values.
Normalization/Scaling: Standardize data to ensure fair comparison.
Encoding: Convert categorical data into numerical formats (e.g., one-hot encoding).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze data distributions, detect outliers, and visualize relationships between features to gain insights and inform model selection.

Feature Selection:
Identify the most influential variables for segmentation. Techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) can reduce dimensionality and improve efficiency.

Modeling Techniques:
Common algorithms include:

K-Means Clustering: Simple and widely used for segmenting customers based on numerical data.
Hierarchical Clustering: Useful for creating a hierarchy of segments.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluate clusters using metrics like the Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, or elbow method (for optimal K selection in K-Means).
